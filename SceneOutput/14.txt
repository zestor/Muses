He knows that he has made their lives better. Suddenly, Grath hears a scream from one of the houses. He runs towards the house and finds a woman lying on the ground, ill. He picks her up and carries her out to the village square. He starts to clean her up and can see that she is getting weaker. He asks the villagers to bring him some cloths and he starts to sing a soft, soothing song. The woman starts to relax and her breathing slows. Grath knows that she is going to be all right.
