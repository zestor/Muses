Grath Zeras stood in the middle of the village, his heart still pounding from the fight. He knew that he had to stay alert, and he didn't want the bandits to hurt the villagers. He scanned the darkness, his hand on his sword, but there was no sign of the bandits. He breathed a sigh of relief and sheathed his sword. He would have to keep watch, but for now, the village was safe. The villagers were gathered around him, their faces pale in the moonlight. He could see the fear in their eyes, and he knew that they were depending on him to keep them safe. He would not let them down.
