Grath cautiously enters the house the bandit had been trying to break into. He knows that the bandit could be hiding inside, waiting to ambush him. He is ready for anything, but he doesn't see anyone. He cautiously makes his way through the house, checking each room for the bandit. He finally finds the bandit hiding in a closet. The bandit jumps out at him with a knife, but Grath is faster. He grabs the bandit's arm and twists it, disarming the bandit. He then grabs the bandit by the throat and slams him against the wall. The bandit is gasping for air, and Grath doesn't hesitate. He pulls out his knife and slits the bandit's throat. The body falls to the ground with a thud, and Grath moves on. He knows that there are more bandits out there, and he has to find them before they can hurt anyone else.
