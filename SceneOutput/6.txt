Grath continues to search the village for the remaining bandits. He is getting tired, and he knows that he can't let his guard down. He hears a noise coming from one of the houses, and he tenses, his hand going to his sword. He creeps towards the house, and he peeks inside. He sees a bandit standing over a villager, a knife in his hand. The bandit is about to kill the villager, and Grath knows that he has to act fast. He leaps into the house, his sword drawn, and he runs the bandit through. The bandit collapses to the ground with a thud, and the villager scrambles away, his face pale. Grath turns to the villagers, his face grim. "There are still bandits in the village," he says. The villagers nod, and they hurry to their homes. Grath watches them go, and then he turns to the task at hand. He will find the bandits and he will make sure that the village is safe.
