The children are playing nearby, and the villagers are all smiles. Grath knows that he has done his duty, and he is happy. He looks down at the woman and feels a sense of pride. He knows that he has protected her and the village. He looks around at the children playing and the villagers talking and laughing, and he knows that he has done something good.
