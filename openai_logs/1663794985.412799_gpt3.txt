PROTAGONIST: 
Randy Walkins

PREVIOUS SCENE: 
Randy is deep in thought, trying to figure out what to do next. He knows that he needs to find out more about the Ones and stop them, but he doesn't know how. He's not sure who he can trust. He looks up as Mr. Williams walks back into the office. "Randy, I forgot to mention," he says. "There's been another attack." Randy's heart sinks. He knows that this means more people have died. He knows that he needs to do something, but he doesn't know what. "Do you have any idea who did it?" he asks. Mr. Williams shakes his head. "No, but we're going to find out. I promise you that." Randy nods, but he doesn't feel any better. He knows that the Ones are out there somewhere, and he needs to stop them. But how?

PLOT QUEUE:
a failed experiment.

CHARACTERS:
Randy Walkins-A banker who was recently attacked by a group of men. He is shaken up by the encounter and doesn't know who his attackers were or what they want from him. He is currently at his desk at Southern Rebel Savings and Loan in downtown Charlotte, North Carolina. His mind is racing as he tries to piece together what he knows about the Ones. He knows that they are a powerful and dangerous organization, and he knows that they are after him. He doesn't know why, but he knows that he needs to be careful. He needs to find out more about them and stop them before they can hurt anyone else. 
Mr. Williams-Randy's boss. He is concerned about Randy's recent behavior. He is a tall, imposing figure. He walks back to his office after speaking with Randy. 
Red Element-A secret organization that is protecting Randy Walkins. They are aware of the danger that the Ones pose to Randy.

BACKGROUND:
Randy Walkins is the illegitimate son of two fallen angels, and has been protected from the Ones by a secret organization called Red Element. He has superpowers unknown to him that are closest to Kutuks. God (leader of the Kutuks) is returning from a distance planet through a portal to Earth, and Randy must gather a resistance of The Ones to battle him. Randy's boss, Mr. Williams, interrupts him while he's deep in thought and tells him to try and clear his head because they have a lot of work to do. Randy has a sneaking suspicion that his attackers from the weekend are somehow connected to the Ones, and he knows that he needs to be careful. He needs to find out more about them and stop them before they can hurt anyone else.
