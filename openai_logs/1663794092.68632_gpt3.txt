He rubs his eyes and looks around. He's not sure if it was all a dream or not. He starts to get up and is surprised to find that his ankle is healed. He remembers that he hurt it when he fell asleep. He starts to walk to the door and is stopped by a voice. "Randy, don't go." Randy turns to see the person from the Red Element. They look just as they did in his dream. "You're the chosen one," they say. "You're the one who is going to lead the rebellion against God." "But why me?" Randy asks. "I'm just a banker. I don't have any special skills or talents. I'm not even that religious." "It doesn't matter," the personfrom the Red Element says. "You have the blood of the Fallen Angels flowing through your veins. That makes you special."
