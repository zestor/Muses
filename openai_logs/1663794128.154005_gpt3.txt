Summarize this story:
Randy is the illegitimate son of two fallen angels who are preparing for the return of God. When God returns, they plan to rebel against him. Randy is brought into a room where people are chanting and is told that they are preparing for God's return. He falls asleep and has a vision in which he is told that he is the chosen one who will lead the rebellion. Randy wakes up to find the room empty. His first thought is that it was all a dream. He rubs his eyes and looks around. He's not sure if it was all a dream or not. He starts to get up and is surprised to find that his ankle is healed. He remembers that he hurt it when he fell asleep. He starts to walk to the door and is stopped by a voice. "Randy, don't go." Randy turns to see the person from the Red Element. They look just as they did in his dream. "You're the chosen one," they say. "You're the one who is going to lead the rebellion against God." "But why me?" Randy asks. "I'm just a banker. I don't have any special skills or talents. I'm not even that religious." "It doesn't matter," the personfrom the Red Element says. "You have the blood of the Fallen Angels flowing through your veins. That makes you special." "But what can I do? I don't even know where to start." "You will," the person from the Red Element says. "When the time is right, you will know what to do."
Randy is in his apartment, pacing back and forth. He's still trying to figure out if what happened was real or just a dream. He rubs his eyes and sits down on the couch. He's not sure what to do or where to start. He's scared and doesn't know if he's up for the task. Suddenly, there's a knock at the door. Randy gets up and answers it. He's surprised to see the person from the Red Element. "I thought you were just a dream," he says. "No, I'm real," the person from the Red Element says. "I'm here to help you." "Help me with what?" "Help you with your quest," the person from the Red Element says. "Quest?" "What quest?" "Your quest for gold," the person from the Red Element says. "What are you talking about?" "You're the chosen one," the person from the Red Element says. "You're supposed to lead the rebellion against God. And you're going to need all the gold you can get your hands on to do it."
