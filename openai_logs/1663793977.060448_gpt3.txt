Summarize this story:
In 3000 B.C., A hostile alien race called Kutuks who can travel space time, arrived in this universe on Mars. Kutuks were also known as gods or angels. The Kutuk leader was known as God. They mined Mars with slave beings from other parallel universes. They discovered a primitive humanoid race on Earth much like themselves. They modified the DNA of this primitive human race on Earth to make them more intellectual and suitable as mining slaves. Some of the benevolent Kutuks took human wives and had an angel human hybrid race call the Nephilim. God was unhappy about this and banished one third of the benevolent Kutuks to Earth calling them fallen angels, stripping them of their powerful weapons and armor. God took two thirds of the hostile angel Kutuks and left this universe looking for other parallel universes where Gold could be mined. Gold is a required element for parallel universe travel. Kutuks seek Gold. The fallen angels worked fiercely on Earth to control the human DNA in secret, preparing a rebellion race, for when God may return. the Fallen Angels are also known as The Ones. The Ones feverishly try to manage a group of humans with blood and DNA closest to the original fallen angels who were banished to Earth. Earth technology improves and time moves forward to modern day. Randy Walkins is illegitimate son of two fallen angels, the purest of The Ones bloodline remaining on Earth. Randy has been protected from the Ones by a secret organization called Red Element. Randy has super powers unknown to him that are closest to Kutuks. Randy is the protagonist of the story, he cannot die. Randy will he gather a resistance of The Ones and will lead the resistance against God (leader of the Kutuks) who is returning from a distance planet through a portal to Earth. It will be quite some time before Randy has established a resistance who can battle God (leader of the Kutuks). Randy and God (leader of the Kutuks) never meet in person. Randy doesnt know the date or time God (leader of the Kutuks) will return. Randy will slowly learn about his relevance to this history and build the resistance preparing to battle God (leader of the Kutuks).
Randy is sitting at his desk, thinking about the coming week. He has a lot of work to do and he's not looking forward to it. Suddenly, he hears a loud noise outside. He gets up to see what it is and he sees a huge portal opening up in the sky. He knows instantly what it is and he knows he has to do something. He runs to the nearest phone and calls the Red Element. He tells them what's happening and they tell him to stay put. They say they're sending someone to pick him up. He hangs up the phone and he waits. He knows he can't do anything alone. He has to wait for the Red Element to arrive. He looks out the window and he sees the portal getting larger and larger. He knows he doesn't have much time. He has to do something. He runs to the nearest window and he opens it. He climbs out onto the fire escape and he starts to climb down. He knows he has to get as far away from the portal as possible. He climbs down as fast as he can, but he's not fast enough. The portal opens up and a huge creature comes out. Randy is frozen in fear. He knows he's going to die. The creature comestowards him and he closes his eyes, waiting for the end.
