story:
Grath was hammering away at a piece of metal, shaping it into a sword, when he heard a voice behind him. "Grath, is that you?" He turned to see a figure shrouded in a hooded cloak, standing in the doorway of the forge. "I thought you were dead!" The figure stepped forward, and Grath saw that it was his old friend, Jarl. "What are you doing here?" Grath asked, astonished. "I've come to warn you," Jarl said, "The dragon is coming. You need to get out of here!"

Grath was hammering away at a piece of metal, shaping it into a sword, when he heard a voice behind him. "Grath, is that you?" He turned to see a figure shrouded in a hooded cloak, standing in the doorway of the forge. "I thought you were dead!" The figure stepped forward, and Grath saw that it was his old friend, Jarl. "What are you doing here?" Grath asked, astonished. "I've come to warn you," Jarl said, "The dragon is coming. You need to get out of here!" Grath could hardly believe his eyes. Jarl was alive! But what was he talking about? A dragon? That was ridiculous. There hadn't been a dragon seen in these parts in generations. "Jarl, you're not making any sense," he said. "What are you talking about?" "It's true, I swear it!" Jarl said. "I saw it with my own eyes. It's huge, and it's headed this way. You have to get out of here, Grath. It's coming to destroy this place." Grath's heart sank as he realized Jarl was telling the truth.
