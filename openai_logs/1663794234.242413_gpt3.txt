story:
Randy wakes up to find himself in a dark room. He can't see anything, but he can hear the sound of someone breathing. He tries to get up, but he's restrained. He feels a panic start to rise in him. "Who's there?" he asks. "What do you want from me?" There is a pause and then a voice speaks. "We want you to lead us, Randy. We want you to help us overthrow God." Randy's heart starts to race. He can't believe what he's hearing. "Why me? I can't do that! I'm not even sure I believe in God." The voice comes closer. "That doesn't matter. What matters is that you have the power to lead us. You have the power to make change. Will you help us, Randy?" Randy is silent for a moment. He doesn't know what to say. This is all too much for him. But then he remembers the look on the person from the Red Element's face. He remembers the way they said his name. "Yes," he says. "I'll help you."
