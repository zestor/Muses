Summarize this story:
In 3000 B.C., A hostile alien race called Kutuks who can travel space time, arrived in this universe on Mars. Kutuks were also known as gods or angels. The Kutuk leader was known as God. They mined Mars with slave beings from other parallel universes. They discovered a primitive humanoid race on Earth much like themselves. They modified the DNA of this primitive human race on Earth to make them more intellectual and suitable as mining slaves. Some of the benevolent Kutuks took human wives and had an angel human hybrid race call the Nephilim. God was unhappy about this and banished one third of the benevolent Kutuks to Earth calling them fallen angels, stripping them of their powerful weapons and armor. God took two thirds of the hostile angel Kutuks and left this universe looking for other parallel universes where Gold could be mined. Gold is a required element for parallel universe travel. Kutuks seek Gold. The fallen angels worked fiercely on Earth to control the human DNA in secret, preparing a rebellion race, for when God may return. the Fallen Angels are also known as The Ones. The Ones feverishly try to manage a group of humans with blood and DNA closest to the original fallen angels who were banished to Earth. Earth technology improves and time moves forward to modern day. Randy Walkins is illegitimate son of two fallen angels, the purest of The Ones bloodline remaining on Earth. Randy has been protected from the Ones by a secret organization called Red Element. Randy has super powers unknown to him that are closest to Kutuks. Randy is the protagonist of the story, he cannot die. Randy will he gather a resistance of The Ones and will lead the resistance against God (leader of the Kutuks) who is returning from a distance planet through a portal to Earth. It will be quite some time before Randy has established a resistance who can battle God (leader of the Kutuks). Randy and God (leader of the Kutuks) never meet in person. Randy doesnt know the date or time God (leader of the Kutuks) will return. Randy will slowly learn about his relevance to this history and build the resistance preparing to battle God (leader of the Kutuks).
Randy Walkins sits at his desk at Southern Rebel Savings and Loan in downtown Charlotte, North Carolina on a Monday morning. His mind is racing with the events of the weekend. He had been out with his friends, celebrating his birthday, when he was attacked by a group of men. He doesn't know who they were or why they attacked him, but he is certain that they were after him specifically. He is shaken by the encounter and can't help but feel like something is coming for him. He recalls the feel of the men's fists pounding into his flesh, the smell of their sweat and beer, and the sound of their laughter as they knocked him to the ground. He can still see their faces, contorted in rage, as they kicked him and stomped on him. He feels a wave of fear wash over him as he realizes that he has no idea who his attackers were or what they want from him.
