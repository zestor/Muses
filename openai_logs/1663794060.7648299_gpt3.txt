story:
"But why me?" Randy asks. "I'm just a banker. I don't have any special skills or talents. I'm not even that religious." "It doesn't matter," the person from the Red Element says. "You have the blood of the Fallen Angels flowing through your veins. That makes you special." "But what can I do? I don't even know where to start." "You will," the person from the Red Element says. "When the time is right, you will know what to do."
