==========

Grath was hammering away at a piece of metal, shaping it into a sword, when he heard a voice behind him. "Grath, is that you?" He turned to see a figure shrouded in a hooded cloak, standing in the doorway of the forge. "I thought you were dead!" The figure stepped forward, and Grath saw that it was his old friend, Jarl. "What are you doing here?" Grath asked, astonished. "I've come to warn you," Jarl said, "The dragon is coming. You need to get out of here!"
