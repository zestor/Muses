The person from the Red Element tells Randy to sit down and relax. Randy does as he's told and tries to calm down. He closes his eyes and takes a few deep breaths. He feels a bit better, but he's still scared. He opens his eyes and looks around. He sees people of all different ages, races, and genders. He feels a bit more at ease knowing that he's not alone. The person from the Red Element starts to speak, but Randy can't understand what they're saying. He looks around and sees that everyone else is nodding along, so he assumes that they understand what's being said. He feels lost and alone in the room. He's not sure what he's supposed to do or where he's supposed to go.
