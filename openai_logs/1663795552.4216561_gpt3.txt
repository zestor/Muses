==========

Randy was at home in his small cottage on the outskirts of Debus when he heard a commotion coming from the village. He grabbed his sword and shield and ran towards the noise. When he arrived he saw the village was being attacked by a group of Orcs. The Orcs were smashing through the houses and killing anyone they found. Randy charged at the Orcs and started swinging his sword. He managed to kill a few of them before they overwhelmed him. The last thing he saw was an Orc bringing its sword down towards his head.
