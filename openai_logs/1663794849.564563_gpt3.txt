PROTAGONIST: 
Randy Walkins

PREVIOUS SCENE: 
Randy Walkins sits at his desk at Southern Rebel Savings and Loan in downtown Charlotte, North Carolina on a Monday morning. His mind is racing with the events of the weekend. He had been out with his friends, celebrating his birthday, when he was attacked by a group of men. He doesn't know who they were or why they attacked him, but he is certain that they were after him specifically. He is shaken by the encounter and can't help but feel like something is coming for him. He recalls the feel of the men's fists pounding into his flesh, the smell of their sweat and beer, and the sound of their laughter as they knocked him to the ground. He can still see their faces, contorted in rage, as they kicked him and stomped on him. He feels a wave of fear wash over him as he realizes that he has no idea who his attackers were or what they want from him.

NEXT SCENE:


==========

Randy is sitting at his desk, lost in thought, when he is interrupted by his boss, Mr. Williams. "Randy, are you okay? You've been really out of it lately." Mr. Williams looks concerned. "I'm fine, Mr. Williams. Just a lot on my mind." Randy forces a smile. "Well, try to clear your head. We have a lot of work to do today." Mr. Williams walks back to his office. Randy tries to focus on his work, but he can't help but feel like something is coming for him. He has a sneaking suspicion that his attackers from the weekend are somehow connected to the Ones, and he knows that he needs to be careful. He needs to find out more about them and stop them before they can hurt anyone else.
