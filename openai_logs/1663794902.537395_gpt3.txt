Summarize this story:
Randy Walkins is the illegitimate son of two fallen angels, and has been protected from the Ones by a secret organization called Red Element. He has super powers unknown to him that are closest to Kutuks. God (leader of the Kutuks) is returning from a distance planet through a portal to Earth, and Randy must gather a resistance of The Ones to battle him. Randy's boss, Mr. Williams, interrupts him while he's deep in thought and tells him to try and clear his head because they have a lot of work to do. Randy has a sneaking suspicion that his attackers from the weekend are somehow connected to the Ones, and he knows that he needs to be careful. He needs to find out more about them and stop them before they can hurt anyone else.
Randy is at his desk, lost in thought, when he is interrupted by his boss, Mr. Williams. Mr. Williams is a tall, imposing figure, and Randy can't help but feel a little intimidated as he looks up at him. Mr. Williams asks Randy if he has a moment, and Randy nods, getting up from his desk to follow Mr. Williams to his office.
