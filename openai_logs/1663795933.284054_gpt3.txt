SCENE: 
Suddenly, he heard a noise coming from one of the houses. He tensed, his hand going to his sword, and he crept towards the house. He peered inside, and he saw a bandit standing over a villager, a knife in his hand. The bandit was about to kill the villager, and Grath knew that he had to act fast. He leapt into the house, his sword drawn, and he ran the bandit through. The bandit collapsed to the ground with a thud, and the villager scrambled away, his face pale. Grathturned to the villagers, his face grim. "There are still bandits in the village," he said. "I will find them and I will kill them. You must stay in your homes and lock your doors. Do not come out until I say it is safe." The villagers nodded, and they hurried to their homes. Grath watched them go, and then he turned to the task at hand. He would find the bandits and he would make sure that the village was safe. He crept through the village, his sword at the ready, and he listened for any sign of the bandits.
