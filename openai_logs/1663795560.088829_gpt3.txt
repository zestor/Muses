SCENE: 
Randy was at home in his small cottage on the outskirts of Debus when he heard a commotion coming from the village. He grabbed his sword and shield and ran towards the noise. When he arrived he saw the village was being attacked by a group of Orcs. The Orcs were smashing through the houses and killing anyone they found. Randy charged at the Orcs and started swinging his sword. He managed to kill a few of them before they overwhelmed him. The last thing he saw was an Orc bringing its sword down towards his head. As the sword came down, Randy thought about his life and how it was about to end. He thought about his wife and child and how they would never see him again. He thought about the village and how it would be destroyed if he didn't stop the Orcs. As the sword came down, Randy closed his eyes and prepared for the end.
