PROTAGONIST: 
Randy Walkins

PREVIOUS SCENE: 
Randy is sitting at his desk, trying to focus on his work. Suddenly, his boss, Mr. Williams, walks into his office. Mr. Williams is a tall, imposing figure. He looks at Randy with concern. "Randy, I've been noticing some strange behavior from you lately. What's going on?" Randy knows that he can't tell his boss the truth. He can't let him know about the Ones. But he also can't lie to him. He needs to find a way to tell him the truth without revealing too much. "I'm just I'm just worried about something, that's all," Randy says. "Worried about what?" Mr. Williams asks. "I can't tell you. I'm sorry." Mr. Williams looks at Randy for a long moment. Then he sighs. "I understand. We all have our secrets. Just try to clear your head, okay? We have a lot of work to do." Randy nods. He knows that he needs to be careful. He can't let the Ones find out about his connection to Red Element. He needs to find out more about them and stop them before they can hurt anyone else.

PLOT QUEUE:
It's a heist.

CHARACTERS:
Randy Walkins-A banker who was recently attacked by a group of men. He is shaken up by the encounter and doesn't know who his attackers were or what they want from him. He is currently at his desk at Southern Rebel Savings and Loan in downtown Charlotte, North Carolina. His mind is racing as he tries to piece together what he knows about the Ones. He knows that they are a powerful and dangerous organization, and he knows that they are after him. He doesn't know why, but he knows that he needs to be careful. He needs to find out more about them and stop them before they can hurt anyone else. 
Mr. Williams-Randy's boss. He is concerned about Randy's recent behavior. He is a tall, imposing figure. He walks back to his office after speaking with Randy. 
Red Element-A secret organization that is protecting Randy Walkins. They are aware of the danger that the Ones pose to Randy.

BACKGROUND:
Randy Walkins is the illegitimate son of two fallen angels, and has been protected from the Ones by a secret organization called Red Element. He has superpowers unknown to him that are closest to Kutuks. God (leader of the Kutuks) is returning from a distance planet through a portal to Earth, and Randy must gather a resistance of The Ones to battle him. Randy's boss, Mr. Williams, interrupts him while he's deep in thought and tells him to try and clear his head because they have a lot of work to do. Randy has a sneaking suspicion that his attackers from the weekend are somehow connected to the Ones, and he knows that he needs to be careful. He needs to find out more about them and stop them before they can hurt anyone else.

NEXT SCENE:


==========

Randy is sitting at his desk, lost in thought. He's trying to piece together what he knows about the Ones. He knows that they are a powerful and dangerous organization, and he knows that they are after him. He doesn't know why, but he knows that he needs to be careful. He needs to find out more about them and stop them before they can hurt anyone else. Suddenly, his train of thought is interrupted by a knock at his office door. He gets up to answer it, and he is surprised to see his boss, Mr. Williams, standing there. "Can I come in?" Mr. Williams asks. Randy nods and steps aside to let him in. Mr. Williams walks into the office and takes a seat in one of the chairs in front of Randy's desk. "I wanted to talk to you about what you said earlier," Mr. Williams begins. "I know you said you couldn't tell me what was going on, but I want you to know that you can trust me. I'm here to help you, Randy. Whatever it is, we'll figure it out together."
