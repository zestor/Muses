Randy is sitting at his desk, lost in thought, when he is interrupted by his boss, Mr. Williams. Once they're in Mr. Williams' office, he closes the door and sits down behind his desk. He looks at Randy for a moment before speaking. "I'm concerned about your recent behavior, Randy," he says. "You've been acting strange ever since the attack." Randy nods, understanding what Mr. Williams is saying. He knows that he's been acting differently, but he can't help it. He's still shaken up from the attack and he's trying to piece together what he knows about the Ones. "I'm sorry, Mr. Williams," Randy says. "I'll try to do better." Mr. Williams nods and studies Randy for a moment before speaking again. "I hope so, Randy," he says. "We need you at your best." With that, Mr. Williams dismisses Randy and he goes back to his desk.
