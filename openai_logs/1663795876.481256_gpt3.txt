PROTAGONIST: 
Grath Zeras

PREVIOUS SCENE: 
The sun had set and the village was plunged into darkness. A cool breeze blew through the streets, and the only sound was the occasional drunken laugh coming from the tavern. Grath Zeras dismounted his horse and tied it to a post outside the tavern. He could hear the sound of laughter and music coming from inside, and he knew that the villagers were celebrating his victory. He didn't want to interrupt their fun, so he decided to head to the stables and get some sleep. He was just about to enter the stables when he heard a noise coming from the other side of the village. He drew his sword and ran towards the sound, his heart pounding in his chest. When he got there, he saw the band of bandits that he had fought earlier. They were back, and this time they had brought reinforcements. Grath Zeras knew that he couldn't take on all of them by himself, but he didn't want the bandits to hurt the villagers. He had to do something. He charged towards the bandits, screaming at the top of his lungs. The bandits were so surprised that they didn't even have time to react before Grath was upon them. He hacked and slashed at them, his sword a blur of movement. The bandits didn't stand a chance against him, and soon they were all lying on theground, dead or dying. Grath Zeras breathed a sigh of relief and leaned against a tree, his heart still pounding. He knew that the village was safe now, but he also knew that he would have to keep watch. He couldn't let his guard down, not even for a moment.
