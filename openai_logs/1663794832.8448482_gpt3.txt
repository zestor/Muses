SCENE: 
Randy Walkins sits at his desk at Southern Rebel Savings and Loan in downtown Charlotte, North Carolina on a Monday morning. His mind is racing with the events of the weekend. He had been out with his friends, celebrating his birthday, when he was attacked by a group of men. He doesn't know who they were or why they attacked him, but he is certain that they were after him specifically. He is shaken by the encounter and can't help but feel like something is coming for him. He recalls the feel of the men's fists pounding into his flesh, the smell of their sweat and beer, and the sound of their laughter as they knocked him to the ground. He can still see their faces, contorted in rage, as they kicked him and stomped on him. He feels a wave of fear wash over him as he realizes that he has no idea who his attackers were or what they want from him.
