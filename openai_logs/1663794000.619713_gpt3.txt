God, the leader of the Kutuks, is unhappy with this and banishes one third of the aliens to Earth, stripping them of their weapons and armor. The aliens left on Earth, called the fallen angels, begin to secretly prepare a rebellion. They try to control a group of humans with the purest bloodline of the fallen angels.

We have to be prepared."
