Randy is sitting at his desk, trying to focus on his work. Suddenly, his boss, Mr. Williams, walks into his office. Mr. Williams is a tall, imposing figure. He looks at Randy with concern. "Randy, I've been noticing some strange behavior from you lately. What's going on?" Randy knows that he can't tell his boss the truth. He can't let him know about the Ones. But he also can't lie to him. He needs to find a way to tell him the truth without revealing too much. "I'm just I'm just worried about something, that's all." "Worried about what?" "I can't tell you. I'm sorry." Mr. Williams looks at Randy for a long moment. Then he sighs. "I understand. We all have our secrets. Just try to clear your head, okay? We have a lot of work to do." Randy nods. He knows that he needs to be careful. He can't let the Ones find out about his connection to Red Element. He needs to find out more about them and stop them before they can hurt anyone else.
