Summarize this story:
Randy Walkins is the illegitimate son of two fallen angels, and has been protected from the Ones by a secret organization called Red Element. He has superpowers unknown to him that are closest to Kutuks. God (leader of the Kutuks) is returning from a distance planet through a portal to Earth, and Randy must gather a resistance of The Ones to battle him. Randy's boss, Mr. Williams, interrupts him while he's deep in thought and tells him to try and clear his head because they have a lot of work to do. Randy has a sneaking suspicion that his attackers from the weekend are somehow connected to the Ones, and he knows that he needs to be careful. He needs to find out more about them and stop them before they can hurt anyone else.
Randy is sitting at his desk, lost in thought, when he is interrupted by his boss, Mr. Williams. Once they're in Mr. Williams' office, he closes the door and sits down behind his desk. He looks at Randy for a moment before speaking. "I'm concerned about your recent behavior, Randy," he says. "You've been acting strange ever since the attack." Randy nods, understanding what Mr. Williams is saying. He knows that he's been acting differently, but he can't help it. He's still shaken up from the attack and he's trying to piece together what he knows about the Ones. "I'm sorry, Mr. Williams," Randy says. "I'll try to do better." Mr. Williams nods and studies Randy for a moment before speaking again. "I hope so, Randy," he says. "We need you at your best." With that, Mr. Williams dismisses Randy and he goes back to his desk.
