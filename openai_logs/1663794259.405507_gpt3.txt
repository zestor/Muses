"Randy, please take a seat," the person from the Red Element says. Randy does as he's told, and the person continues. "We have all been waiting for you. We all knew you were special." Randy looks around the room and sees people of all different ages, races, and genders. "Why me?" "What makes me so special?" The person from the Red Element smiles. "You have a power that no one else has, Randy. You have the power to lead us. You have the power to make change." The other people in the room start to clap, and Randy feels a sense of pride swelling up inside of him. He knows that he can do this. He knows that he can lead the rebellion and overthrow God.
