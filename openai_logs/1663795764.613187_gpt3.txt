==========

Grath Zeras arrived at the Debus village after a long journey through the Azor mountain range. The village was nestled in a valley between two great peaks. Grath could see the smoke rising from the volcano in the distance. As he approached the village, he could see the people were busy preparing for the tribute ceremony. Grath was not looking forward to this. He had seen too many people burned alive in the volcano's lava.
