story:
Grath makes his way through the village, checking each house for signs of the bandits. He knows that they could be hiding anywhere, waiting to ambush him. He is getting tired, but he can't let his guard down. His eyes feel heavy and his limbs feel like lead, but he can't allow himself to rest. If he does, it could mean the difference between life and death. He finally comes to the last house in the village and he is about to enter when he hears a noise from inside. He knows that the bandits are inside, and he is ready for them. He kicks the door open and charges into the house, sword drawn. He is met by a group of bandits, and he doesn't hesitate. He swings his sword, and the first bandit falls. The others come at him, but he is ready for them. He ducks and dodges their attacks, and then he strikes. He cuts them down one by one until they are all lying on the ground, dead. He is covered in blood and he is panting from the effort of the fight, but he knows that the village is safe now. He can finally rest.
