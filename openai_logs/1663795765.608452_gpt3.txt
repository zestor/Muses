==========

Grath Zeras rode his mount through the dense forest, his armor clanking in the silence. He had been on the trail of a band of bandits for days, and was getting close. He could sense them nearby, hiding in the shadows, waiting to ambush him. But he was not afraid. He was a master at arms, and had faced worse foes than these. He rounded a corner and saw them waiting for him, swords drawn. He drew his own weapon and charged. The battle was fierce, but Grath prevailed. He sent the bandits running, and rode back to the village to warn them of the danger.
