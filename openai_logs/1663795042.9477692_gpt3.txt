But he also can't lie to him. He needs to find a way to tell him the truth without revealing too much. "I'm just I'm just worried about something, that's all," Randy says. "Worried about what?" Mr. Williams asks. "I can't tell you. I'm sorry." Mr. Williams looks at Randy for a long moment. Then he sighs. "I understand. We all have our secrets. Just try to clear your head, okay? We have a lot of work to do." Randy nods. He knows that he needs to be careful. He can't let the Ones find out about his connection to Red Element.
