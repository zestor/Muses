He is ready for anything, but he doesn't see anyone. He cautiously makes his way through the house, checking each room for the bandit. He finally finds the bandit hiding in a closet. The bandit jumps out at him with a knife, but Grath is faster. He grabs the bandit's arm and twists it, disarming the bandit. He then grabs the bandit by the throat and slams him against the wall.
