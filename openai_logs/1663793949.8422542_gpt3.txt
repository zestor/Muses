In 3000 B.C., A hostile alien race called Kutuks who can travel space time, arrived in this universe on Mars. Kutuks were also known as gods or angels. The Kutuk leader was known as God. They mined Mars with slave beings from other parallel universes. They discovered a primitive humanoid race on Earth much like themselves. They modified the DNA of this primitive human race on Earth to make them more intellectual and suitable as mining slaves. Some of the benevolent Kutuks took human wives and had an angel human hybrid race call the Nephilim. God was unhappy about this and banished one third of the benevolent Kutuks to Earth calling them fallen angels, stripping them of their powerful weapons and armor. God took two thirds of the hostile angel Kutuks and left this universe looking for other parallel universes where Gold could be mined. Gold is a required element for parallel universe travel. Kutuks seek Gold. The fallen angels worked fiercely on Earth to control the human DNA in secret, preparing a rebellion race, for when God may return. the Fallen Angels are also known as The Ones. The Ones feverishly try to manage a group of humans with blood and DNA closest to the original fallen angels who were banished to Earth. Earth technology improves and time moves forward to modern day. Randy Walkins is illegitimate son of two fallen angels, the purest of The Ones bloodline remaining on Earth.
