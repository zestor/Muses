story:
Randy is in his apartment, pacing back and forth. He's still trying to figure out if what happened was real or just a dream. He rubs his eyes and sits down on the couch. He's not sure what to do or where to start. He's scared and doesn't know if he's up for the task. Suddenly, there's a knock at the door. Randy gets up and answers it. He's surprised to see the person from the Red Element. "I thought you were just a dream," he says. "No, I'm real," the person from the Red Element says. "I'm here to help you." "Help me with what?" "Help you with your quest," the person from the Red Element says. "Quest?" "What quest?" "Your quest for gold," the person from the Red Element says. "What are you talking about?" "You're the chosen one," the person from the Red Element says. "You're supposed to lead the rebellion against God. And you're going to need all the gold you can get your hands on to do it."
