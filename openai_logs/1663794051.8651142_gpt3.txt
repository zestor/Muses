Summarize this story:
Randy is the illegitimate son of two fallen angels who are preparing for the return of God. When God returns, they plan to rebel against him. Randy is brought into a room where people are chanting and is told that they are preparing for God's return. He falls asleep and has a vision in which he is told that he is the chosen one who will lead the rebellion.
Randy wakes up to find the room empty. His first thought is that it was all a dream. He rubs his eyes and looks around. He's not sure if it was all a dream or not. He starts to get up and is surprised to find that his ankle is healed. He remembers that he hurt it when he fell asleep. He starts to walk to the door and is stopped by a voice. "Randy, don't go." Randy turns to see the person from the Red Element. They look just as they did in his dream. "You're the chosen one," they say. "You're the one who is going to lead the rebellion against God."
